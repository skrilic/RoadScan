# RoadScan
 This is a Python program written for Linux. It logs the spectrum of the predefined frequency band in
relation to GPS position. It reads out GPS position by using GPS Babel and signal levels from an FSH6 spectrum analyzer and logs both in the file. For every measurement position, the spectrum plot was created. There is also maplayer.py utility for creating the KML file of the measurement.
