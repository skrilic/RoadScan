[level]
#GSM 11.10 required echo attenuation
#of 46 dB and stipulated artificial
#voice to ITU-T P.50 as the test signal,
#because sinusoidal signals could not
#be used. Since artificial voice has a
#crest factor of approx. 20 dB and the
#peak value must not overdrive the
#coder, only an rms value of at least
#20 dB below the full-scale value can
#be attained. The theoretical maximum
#S/N ratio of the GSM system is about
#66 dB, so a pure interfering signal of
#at least 46 dB is still measured even
#if no echo is present. Echo signals of
#>46 dB are normally masked by the
#noise. As a result of the measuring prob-
#lems detected early on, this important
#test was practically no longer carried out
#and excluded from the obligatory mea-
#surements, which had a negative impact
#on the features of many mobile phones.
